Sublime-PHPUnit-Basic
=====================

A very basic Sublime text 2 plugin to run phpunit on the current file.

Package can be run on save, via the Command Palette or a keyboard shortcut.

If phpunit has to be run from a specific folder for your project, that can be set in the settings - run_phpunit_in_folder

##Todo
- Open the test for current file
- Run tests asynchronously
- Add a progress indicator (eg. like Package Control)
